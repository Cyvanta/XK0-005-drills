# Day 3 â€“ Boot Process, Systemd & Service Management

## ðŸš€ Boot Sequence Overview

The Linux boot process happens in this order:

1. **BIOS/UEFI** â€“ Hardware checks & boot device loading
2. **GRUB** â€“ Bootloader that lets you select the OS/kernel
3. **Kernel** â€“ Loads drivers & mounts root filesystem
4. **init/systemd** â€“ Starts system processes and services

## ðŸ”§ Practice Lab

```bash
# View your running kernel
uname -r

# See all active services
systemctl list-units --type=service

# Check status of a service (e.g. ssh)
systemctl status sshd

# Start and enable a service
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd

# Disable and stop a service
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2

# View logs from last boot
journalctl -b
