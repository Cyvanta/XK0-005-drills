| `uptime`             | Show system uptime & load average      |

## ðŸ§ª Practice Lab

```bash
# Monitor real-time system usage
top

# View processes running as any user
ps aux

# Kill a dummy process (replace 1234 with real PID)
kill -9 1234

# View memory and disk space
free -h
df -h

# View system uptime and load
uptime

# View logs
journalctl -xe

# Check service status (e.g. SSH)
systemctl status sshd
